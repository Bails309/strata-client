## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

#### Collaborative Control Mode Shares
- Share links now support two modes: **View** (read-only, default) and **Control** (full keyboard and mouse input forwarding)
- Share popover in the session toolbar presents two buttons — "View Only" and "Control" — with distinct icons and colour badges
- `POST /api/user/connections/:id/share` accepts a `{ "mode": "view" | "control" }` request body
- `mode` column added to `connection_shares` table (`007_share_mode.sql` migration)
- Shared viewer detects mode from URL query parameter (`?mode=control`) and conditionally attaches keyboard input
- Banner in shared viewer displays "Control mode" or "Read-only view" accordingly
- "Generate new link" button in share popover to create a fresh link without closing the popover
- Audit log captures share mode alongside token and connection ID

#### Auto-HTTPS with Caddy
- `Caddyfile` reverse proxy configuration — routes `/api/*` to the Rust backend and everything else to the frontend nginx container
- Caddy service in `docker-compose.yml` under the `https` profile — activate with `docker compose --profile https up`
- Automatic Let's Encrypt TLS certificates when `STRATA_DOMAIN` environment variable is set
- HTTP/3 (QUIC) support via UDP port 443 binding
- Built-in gzip/zstd compression and security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- `caddy-data` and `caddy-config` Docker volumes for certificate and configuration persistence

#### Health & Load Metrics
- Per-session bandwidth tracking via atomic counters — bytes received from guacd and bytes sent to guacd
- `protocol` field added to active session records for per-protocol metrics breakdown
- `GET /api/admin/metrics` — admin endpoint returning aggregate metrics:
  - `active_sessions` — total number of active tunnel sessions
  - `total_bytes_from_guacd` / `total_bytes_to_guacd` — cumulative bandwidth
  - `sessions_by_protocol` — session count grouped by protocol (RDP, SSH, VNC)
- `MetricsSummary` type and `getMetrics()` function added to the frontend API client
- Active session list now includes `protocol`, `bytes_from_guacd`, and `bytes_to_guacd` fields

#### PWA & Tablet Gesture Support
- `manifest.json` — Progressive Web App manifest with standalone display mode, dark theme colour, and app icons
- `sw.js` — Service worker with shell caching (network-first for navigation, cache-first for static assets; API requests are never cached)
- `index.html` updated with `<link rel="manifest">`, `theme-color` meta tag, and Apple mobile web app meta tags
- `viewport-fit=cover` for edge-to-edge rendering on notched devices
- Service worker registration on page load
- **Touch Toolbar** — floating `⌨` button that expands into a horizontal strip of special key combos:
  - Ctrl+Alt+Delete, Windows key, Alt+Tab, Escape, F11, Ctrl+Alt+T (terminal)
  - Renders at bottom-centre of the session view; automatically integrated into SessionClient

#### Sidecar guacd Scaling
- `GuacdPool` service — round-robin connection pool distributing tunnel connections across multiple guacd instances
- `guacd_instances` configuration field (`config.toml`) and `GUACD_INSTANCES` environment variable (comma-separated `host:port` entries)
- Backend automatically builds a pool from the primary guacd instance plus any additional instances
- Tunnel handler picks the next guacd from the pool for each new connection
- `guacd-2` service template in `docker-compose.yml` under the `scale` profile — activate with `docker compose --profile scale up`
- Startup log message reports pool size when more than one instance is configured

#### H.264 GFX Encoding
- RDP connections now default to FreeRDP 3 GFX pipeline with H.264 encoding (`enable-gfx=true`, `enable-gfx-h264=true`) for significantly lower bandwidth usage
- These parameters are set as defaults in the handshake and can be overridden per-connection via the `extra` JSONB field
- `ffmpeg-dev` added to guacd builder stage and `ffmpeg-libs` added to runtime stage for H.264 codec support

### Changed
- `AppError` enum gains a `Validation` variant — returns HTTP 400 for invalid request data (e.g. bad share mode)
- `ActiveSession` struct now includes `protocol` and bandwidth counters
- `SessionInfo` serialisation includes `protocol`, `bytes_from_guacd`, and `bytes_to_guacd`
- `ShareLinkResponse` includes `mode` field in the JSON response
- Share URL for control mode includes `?mode=control` query parameter
- `NvrContext` now carries `protocol` for session registration
- `AppState` includes `guacd_pool` for multi-instance support
- Frontend `ActiveSession` TypeScript type updated with `protocol`, `bytes_from_guacd`, `bytes_to_guacd`
- Docker Compose volumes section expanded with `caddy-data` and `caddy-config`

### Security
- Control mode shares forward keyboard and mouse input to the remote session via the share token — treat control share links with the same sensitivity as credentials
- Caddy security headers added: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- Service worker explicitly excludes `/api` requests from caching — authentication tokens are never cached

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Observe Live** — admin can watch a user’s session in real-time (read-only)
- **Rewind** — admin can rewind up to 5 minutes to see what the user did before they called for help
- NVR Player page (`/observe/:sessionId`) with Guacamole client, status badge (Replaying / LIVE / Ended), elapsed timer, and rewind buttons (30s, 1m, 3m, 5m)

#### Theme & UI
- Light/dark/system theme toggle button in the sidebar (moon/sun icon, cycles System → Light → Dark)
- Refined dark theme: surfaces lifted from near-black to layered charcoal (`#111114` base, `#1a1a1f` cards, `#222228` elevated)
- Cards receive an inset top-edge glass highlight for depth
- Table headers use surface-tertiary background
- Ambient gradients strengthened 50%
- Input fields recessed darker than cards for inset relief

### Changed
- Admin users now see **all** connections on the Dashboard regardless of role assignment (bypasses `role_connections` filter)
- Non-admin users continue to see only connections mapped to their role
- `GET /api/user/connections` response now includes `description`, `group_id`, and `group_name` fields
- `GET /api/admin/connections` response now includes `description` and `group_id` fields
- `POST /api/admin/connections` and `PUT /api/admin/connections/:id` accept `description` (string) and `group_id` (UUID, optional)
- Dashboard `ConnectionRow` displays description below connection name
- Database schema: `006_groups_and_description.sql` migration adds `connection_groups` table and `description`/`group_id` columns to `connections`

### Fixed
- Admin users could not see connections that were not assigned to any group or role on the Dashboard
