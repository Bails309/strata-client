# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **AD Sync Connection Defaults**: AD sync sources can now specify default Guacamole parameters (RDP performance flags, session recording settings) that are applied to all synced connections. Configurable via the new "Connection Defaults" section in the AD Sync edit form.
- **Connection Parameter Tooltips**: All connection settings (Performance, Screen Recording, Authentication) now display descriptive hover tooltips sourced from the official Apache Guacamole documentation.
- **Unified Session Bar**: Consolidated all session-specific controls (Sharing, File Browser, Fullscreen, Pop-out, On-Screen Keyboard) into a single, sleek, collapsible right-side dock.
- **Integrated Touch/OSK Toolbar**: On-screen keyboard shortcuts are now accessible directly within the Session Bar "Quick Tools" section, removing the floating keyboard button from the center of the screen.

### Changed
- **Zero-Footprint Layout**: The Session Bar overlay is now completely transparent to remote screen resolution, allowing remote sessions to utilize the full display area.
- **Smooth Responsive Resizing**: Implemented `ResizeObserver` in the session client to ensure remote sessions scale continuously and smoothly during sidebar/dock transitions, eliminating layout flashes.

### Fixed
- **Large Clipboard Support**: Implemented manual protocol-level text chunking (4096-char blocks) to support transferring massive clipboard content (10,000+ lines) without hitting Guacamole instruction size limits.
- **Backend Buffer Optimization**: Increased tunnel memory buffers to 16MB and explicitly tuned WebSocket message limits to 64MB for robust high-bandwidth data transfers.



### Added
- **Active Sessions Dashboard**: New real-time administrative dashboard for monitoring all active tunnel connections, including bandwidth tracking, duration, and remote host metadata.
- **Administrative Termination**: Administrators can now "kill" any active session directly from the Sessions dashboard, ensuring instant access revocation when needed.

### Changed
- **Reconnection Stability**: Overhauled the session client reconnection logic with 10-second stability thresholds and explicit retry counters to prevent infinite loops on permanent connection failures (e.g., certificate mismatches).
- **Version Synchronization**: Unified backend and frontend versioning to 0.9.0 for improved architectural consistency.

### Fixed
- **Tunnel Proxy Stability**: Resolved Rust borrow checker issues in the tunnel proxy (related to `kill_rx` ownership) and fixed WebSocket ↔ TCP handshake signal handling.
- **TypeScript Type Safety**: Fixed build regressions in the frontend test suite by ensuring all mock session objects include mandatory `remote_host` metadata.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added
- **User Restoration**: Administrators can now restore soft-deleted user accounts from the Admin Settings dashboard within the 7-day retention window.
- **Manual SSL Support**: The Nginx gateway now supports user-provided SSL certificates via volume mount (`cert.pem`, `key.pem`).

### Changed
- **Infrastructure Consolidation**: Removed Caddy reverse proxy. Nginx (Frontend) now acts as the primary gateway, handling SSL termination, API/WebSocket proxying, security headers, and automatic HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.
- **Optional Local Database**: The `postgres-local` service is now moved to a Docker Compose profile (`local-db`), allowing it to be bypassed when using an external database provided in the `.env` file.
- **Environment Overrides**: `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file now correctly takes precedence over the default bundled configuration.

### Fixed
- **Resource Cleanup**: Removed redundant Caddy configurations and volumes.
- **Documentation**: Updated all deployment guides and manual setup instructions to reflect the new Nginx architecture and Docker Compose profiles.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-09

### Added

#### Granular RBAC Permissions
- **9 role-based permissions**: `can_manage_system`, `can_manage_users`, `can_manage_connections`, `can_view_audit_logs`, `can_create_users`, `can_create_user_groups`, `can_create_connections`, `can_create_connection_folders`, `can_create_sharing_profiles`.
- **Role-folder assignments**: New `role_folders` table for many-to-many role-to-folder mapping with dedicated list/update endpoints.
- Permissions are extracted from the database at authentication time and exposed on the `/api/auth/me` response.

#### Connection Folders
- **Renamed `connection_groups` to `connection_folders`** across the full stack (database, API, frontend) for clarity.
- CRUD endpoints for connection folders with proper authorization checks.
- Frontend folder view with collapsible folder headers and per-folder connection counts.

#### Database Migrations
- **020**: `email`, `full_name`, `auth_type` columns on `users` table for strict SSO matching.
- **021**: Soft-delete (`deleted_at`) on users; granular `can_manage_*` / `can_view_*` permission columns on roles.
- **022**: Extended creation permissions (`can_create_users`, `can_create_user_groups`, `can_create_connections`, `can_create_connection_groups`, `can_create_sharing_profiles`).
- **023**: Rename `connection_groups` → `connection_folders` and `can_create_connection_groups` → `can_create_connection_folders` across all tables, indexes, and foreign keys.
- **024**: `role_folders` table for role-based folder access control.

#### Backend — Extracted Pure Functions & Input Validation
- **`redact_settings()`** — redacts sensitive config values (`sso_client_secret`, `vault_token`, `vault_unseal_key`, `ad_bind_password`, `azure_storage_access_key`) from API responses.
- **`validate_no_restricted_keys()`** — prevents updates to security-critical keys (`jwt_secret`, `sso_issuer_url`, `kerberos_realm`, `local_auth_enabled`) through the generic settings endpoint.
- **`is_safe_recording_filename()`** — prevents path traversal in recording download filenames (rejects `..`, `/`, `\`, empty strings).
- **`is_safe_hostname()`** — validates Kerberos hostnames to prevent `krb5.conf` injection.
- Unit tests for all extracted functions (14 new backend tests).

#### Docker Security Hardening
- **Backend**: Runs as non-root `strata:strata` user; pre-creates Guacamole recording and drive directories with correct ownership; `entrypoint.sh` fixes volume permissions before dropping privileges.
- **Frontend**: Runs nginx as non-root `nginx:nginx` user; pre-creates all cache/temp directories and PID file with correct ownership.

#### Documentation
- **`docs/security.md`**: Comprehensive security architecture covering OIDC authentication flow, local auth with Argon2id, authentication method enforcement, route protection matrix, envelope encryption with Vault Transit, and memory zeroization.

### Changed

#### Dependencies
- **sqlx** upgraded from 0.7.x to **0.8** with `runtime-tokio-rustls` feature set.
- **jsonwebtoken** upgraded from v9 to **v10** (`rust_crypto` feature).

#### Frontend Test Coverage
- **634 tests across 24 test files** (up from 605), all passing.
- Coverage thresholds enforced: statements 74%, branches 69%, functions 62%, lines 75%.
- New test suites: **Layout** (sidebar collapse, `useSidebarWidth`, nav highlighting), **AuditLogs** (pagination with Previous/Next), **Dashboard** (Previous page navigation).
- Expanded: **SessionMenu** (clipboard debounce send to remote after timer).

### Fixed
- **Settings redaction**: Sensitive settings are now automatically masked in all API responses.
- **Settings restriction**: Generic settings update endpoint no longer allows modification of security-critical keys.
- **Recording path traversal**: Filename validation prevents directory traversal attacks on recording downloads.
- **Kerberos hostname injection**: Hostname validation prevents shell injection in `krb5.conf` generation.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-09

### Changed

#### Frontend Test Coverage Expansion
- **Branch coverage raised from ~55% to 70%** across 605 tests (up from ~366), significantly improving regression safety.
- **Coverage thresholds enforced** in `vitest.config.ts`: statements 74%, branches 69%, functions 62%, lines 75% (previously 25/25/15/25).
- Expanded test suites for **AdminSettings** (133→145 tests), **Credentials** (28→42), **SessionMenu** (14→20), **FileBrowser** (13→20), **NvrPlayer** (17→23), **SharedViewer** (16→26), **SessionClient** (26→28), **SessionToolbar** (25→27), **SessionBar** (9→13), **SessionManager** (32→35), **TiledView** (16→22), **SessionWatermark** (4→7), **usePopOut** (15→20).
- Added new test files for **Layout** and **Login** components.

#### Backend Security & Reliability Hardening
- **Guacamole protocol parsing**: Improved Unicode character length handling to prevent connection failures with UTF-8 hostnames/credentials.
- **NVR instruction filtering**: Protocol-level opcode matching prevents false positives while blocking credentials in recordings.
- **Kerberos authentication**: Secure unique temporary files via `tempfile` for credential cache and CA certificate handling.
- **Tunnel soft-delete bypass**: Added `soft_deleted_at IS NULL` guard to WebSocket tunnel endpoint.
- **OIDC issuer validation**: Discovery endpoint now verifies returned issuer matches configured provider.
- **Content-Disposition header injection**: Recording download filename properly escaped.
- **Shared tunnel pool bypass**: Shared tunnel endpoint now uses `GuacdPool` for round-robin load distribution.
- **AD sync transaction safety**: Sync operations wrapped in database transactions.
- **`per_page` unbounded**: Pagination parameter now clamped to prevent arbitrarily large result sets.
- **Soft-delete leak fixes**: `connection_info`, `update_connection`, share list, and `revoke_share` endpoints now properly handle soft-deleted connections.
- **AD sync bulk operations**: High-performance bulk upsert/soft-delete query pattern replaces individual updates.
- **Database schema**: Added unique index on `connections(ad_source_id, ad_dn)` for sync integrity.

### Fixed
- Fixed `SessionManager.test.tsx` unused `afterEach` import (should have been `beforeEach`).
- Fixed portal duplicate text rendering in `Credentials` tests by using `aria-selected` attribute matching.
- Fixed canvas painting tests in `SessionWatermark` by mocking `HTMLCanvasElement` `clientWidth`/`clientHeight`.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed

#### Security Hardening
- **Guacamole Protocol Parsing**: Improved parser to handle Unicode character lengths correctly, preventing connection failures or data corruption when using UTF-8 characters in hostnames or credentials.
- **NVR Instruction Filtering**: Refined sensitive instruction detection to use protocol-level opcode matching, preventing false positives while strictly blocking credentials in recordings.
- **Kerberos Authentication**: Hardened credential cache and CA certificate handling by using secure, unique temporary files via the `tempfile` library.
- **Tunnel soft-delete bypass**: WebSocket tunnel endpoint could connect users to soft-deleted connections — added `soft_deleted_at IS NULL` guard
- **OIDC issuer validation**: OIDC discovery endpoint did not verify that the returned issuer matched the configured provider, allowing potential token substitution
- **Content-Disposition header injection**: Recording download filename was not escaped, allowing header injection via crafted connection names
- **Shared tunnel pool bypass**: Shared tunnel endpoint created a direct guacd connection instead of using the `GuacdPool`, bypassing round-robin load distribution

#### Performance & Reliability
- **AD Sync Bulk Operations**: Replaced individual LDAP-to-DB updates with a high-performance **Bulk Upsert** (ON CONFLICT) and **Bulk Soft-Delete** query pattern.
- **Database Schema**: Added unique index on `connections(ad_source_id, ad_dn)` to ensure sync integrity and enable atomic upsert logic.
- **`connection_info` soft-delete leak**: `/api/user/connections/:id/info` returned protocol info for soft-deleted connections
- **`update_connection` soft-delete gap**: Update endpoint did not include a soft-delete filter, allowing edits to deleted connections
- **`update_connection` missing `updated_at`**: Updating a connection did not set `updated_at = now()`, leaving the timestamp stale
- **Share list stale data**: Share list query did not filter out soft-deleted connections
- **`revoke_share` silent no-op**: Revoking a non-existent or already-revoked share returned 200 OK — now returns 404 and checks `NOT revoked`
- **AD sync transaction safety**: AD sync update operations were not wrapped in a database transaction, risking partial updates on failure
- **`per_page` unbounded**: Pagination `per_page` parameter was not clamped, allowing arbitrarily large result sets

### Build
- Fixed unused `afterEach` import in `SessionManager.test.tsx` (should have been `beforeEach`)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added
- **SSO / OIDC (Keycloak) Support**: Integrated OpenID Connect authentication.
  - New endpoints: `GET /api/auth/sso/login` (redirect) and `GET /api/auth/sso/callback` (handler).
  - Secure storage of OIDC client secrets using HashiCorp Vault.
  - Automatic OIDC discovery via `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
- **Configurable Authentication Methods**: Admin can now toggle between Local Authentication and SSO/OIDC in the Security settings.
- **Improved Security Enforcement**: Backend system now strictly enforces the `local_auth_enabled` policy, rejecting local logins when disabled.

### Fixed
- **Security Loophole**: Fixed a flaw where local authentication remained functional even when disabled in the dashboard.
- **UI Consistency**: Resolved an issue where the Security tab checkboxes could appear disabled by default when unconfigured.
- **Build Regressions**: 
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in frontend tests related to unused imports and variables.
  - Resolved `Cannot find name 'vi'` build error in test setup by importing the Vitest utility.
  - Suppressed Rust compiler warnings (`dead_code`, `unreachable_patterns`) in the backend authentication service.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

#### Active Directory LDAP Sync
- Automatic computer account import from Active Directory via LDAP/LDAPS
- AD sync config CRUD API: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/ad-sync-configs`

- Manual sync trigger: `POST /api/admin/ad-sync-configs/:id/sync`
- Sync run history: `GET /api/admin/ad-sync-configs/:id/runs` with per-run stats (created, updated, soft-deleted, hard-deleted)
- Background scheduled sync — configurable interval per source (default: 60 minutes)
- Soft-delete lifecycle — objects that disappear from AD are soft-deleted for 7 days before permanent hard-deletion
- Multiple search bases per config — query multiple OU scopes in a single source, results deduplicated by DN (`015_multi_search_base.sql` migration)
- Search filter presets dropdown: All Computers, Servers Only, Enabled Computers Only, Enabled Servers Only, Custom Filter
- Automatic exclusion of gMSA (`msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount`) and MSA (`msDS-ManagedServiceAccount`) accounts from all preset filters
- Connection group assignment — imported connections can be placed into a specific connection group
- Domain override — optional domain suffix forced onto all imported connections
- Full admin UI in the "AD Sync" tab: source cards with label, URL, auth method, bases, filter, protocol, interval; inline edit form; sync history table

#### AD Sync Authentication Methods
- **Simple Bind** — bind DN + password with LDAP/LDAPS
- **Kerberos Keytab** — `kinit` + `ldapsearch` with GSSAPI via keytab file and configurable principal
- Per-config credential cache (`KRB5CCNAME`) to avoid races between concurrent syncs

#### CA Certificate Upload for LDAPS
- Upload internal CA certificates (PEM/CRT/CER) for LDAPS connections with self-signed or internal CAs
- Custom `rustls` `ClientConfig` built at query time with system roots + uploaded CA (bypasses ldap3's static `CACERTS`)
- Kerberos path writes PEM to temp file and sets `LDAPTLS_CACERT` env var for `ldapsearch`
- UI: file upload button hidden when "Skip TLS verification" is checked; shows "✓ Certificate loaded" with replace/remove actions
- `ca_cert_pem` TEXT column added to `ad_sync_configs` (`014_ca_cert.sql` migration)

#### Multi-Realm Kerberos
- Support for multiple Kerberos realms, each with its own KDCs, admin server, ticket/renew lifetimes, and default flag
- Full CRUD API for Kerberos realms: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/kerberos-realms`
- Dynamic `krb5.conf` generation aggregating all realms with correct `[realms]` and `[domain_realm]` sections
- Realm management UI with inline edit form in the Kerberos admin tab
- `011_multi_kerberos.sql` migration: `kerberos_realms` table with `id`, `realm`, `kdcs`, `admin_server`, `ticket_lifetime`, `renew_lifetime`, `is_default`

#### Credential Profiles
- Saved credential profiles with optional TTL expiry (`credential_profiles` table)
- Profile selector dropdown on the Dashboard connection card — pick a saved profile or enter credentials inline
- `008_credential_profiles.sql`, `009_credential_expiry.sql`, `010_profile_ttl.sql` migrations

#### Kerberos Keytab Auth for AD Sync
- `auth_method` column on `ad_sync_configs`: `simple` or `kerberos` (`013_keytab_auth.sql` migration)
- `keytab_path` and `krb5_principal` fields for keytab-based authentication
- Auth method selector in the AD sync edit form toggles between Simple Bind and Kerberos Keytab fields

### Changed
- `AdSyncConfig` struct: `search_base: String` replaced with `search_bases: Vec<String>` (Postgres `TEXT[]`)
- LDAP query functions accept individual search base parameter; `ldap_query()` iterates over all bases and deduplicates by DN
- All LDAP filter defaults and presets now include `(!(objectClass=msDS-GroupManagedServiceAccount))(!(objectClass=msDS-ManagedServiceAccount))` to exclude service accounts
- Backend dependencies: added `rustls 0.21`, `rustls-pemfile 1`, `rustls-native-certs 0.6` for custom TLS config
- Architecture docs updated with AD sync, multi-realm Kerberos, credential profiles, and CA cert sections
- Database schema docs updated through migration 015

### Fixed
- Empty `search_filter` in DB caused ldap3 filter parse error — now falls back to the default exclusion filter
- ldap3 `UnknownIssuer` TLS error with internal CAs — bypassed static `CACERTS` with per-query custom `ClientConfig`

### Security
- CA certificates stored in database (not filesystem) and loaded per-query — no global mutable state
- Keytab-based authentication uses per-config `KRB5CCNAME` credential cache to prevent cross-config credential leakage
- Bind passwords stored as-is in `ad_sync_configs` (same trust boundary as the admin API) — future: Vault envelope encryption

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

#### Azure Blob Storage for Session Recordings
- Session recordings can now be synced to **Azure Blob Storage** as an external storage backend
- New Admin UI controls in the Recordings tab: storage backend selector (Local / Azure Blob), account name, container name, and access key fields
- Background sync task uploads completed recordings from the local volume to Azure Blob every 60 seconds
- Recording download endpoint falls back to Azure Blob when a file is not found locally
- Azure Blob REST API integration uses SharedKey authentication with HMAC-SHA256 (no extra SDK dependencies)

#### Collaborative Control Mode Shares
- Share links now support two modes: **View** (read-only, default) and **Control** (full keyboard and mouse input forwarding)
- Share popover in the session toolbar presents two buttons — "View Only" and "Control" — with distinct icons and colour badges
- `POST /api/user/connections/:id/share` accepts a `{ "mode": "view" | "control" }` request body
- `mode` column added to `connection_shares` table (`007_share_mode.sql` migration)
- Shared viewer detects mode from URL query parameter (`?mode=control`) and conditionally attaches keyboard input

- `guacd-2` service template in `docker-compose.yml` under the `scale` profile — activate with `docker compose --profile scale up`
- Startup log message reports pool size when more than one instance is configured

#### H.264 GFX Encoding
- RDP connections now default to FreeRDP 3 GFX pipeline with H.264 encoding (`enable-gfx=true`, `enable-gfx-h264=true`) for significantly lower bandwidth usage
- These parameters are set as defaults in the handshake and can be overridden per-connection via the `extra` JSONB field
- `ffmpeg-dev` added to guacd builder stage and `ffmpeg-libs` added to runtime stage for H.264 codec support

#### Rust Backend (Phase 2)
- Axum + Tokio web server with graceful startup (setup vs. running mode)
- `config.toml`-based persistence with auto-detection on boot
- First-boot setup endpoint (`POST /api/setup/initialize`) supporting local and external database selection
- PostgreSQL advisory-lock-protected SQL migrations (`sqlx::migrate!`) for HA-safe schema upgrades
- Full normalized database schema: `system_settings`, `users`, `roles`, `connections`, `role_connections`, `user_credentials`, `audit_logs`
- HashiCorp Vault Transit envelope encryption (`seal` / `unseal`) with AES-256-GCM and `zeroize` memory cleanup
- OIDC token validation via dynamic JWKS discovery (supports Keycloak, Entra ID, any compliant provider)
- JWT authentication middleware (`require_auth`) extracting user identity from Bearer tokens
- Role-based authorization middleware (`require_admin`) for admin-only endpoints
- Dynamic Kerberos `krb5.conf` generation written to shared volume
- Session recording configuration from database settings
- SHA-256 hash-chained immutable audit logging
- Bidirectional WebSocket ↔ TCP proxy tunnel to `guacd` with Guacamole protocol handshake injection
- Role-based connection access control on tunnel establishment
- Admin CRUD API: settings, SSO, Kerberos, recordings, roles, connections, users, audit logs
- User API: profile, role-scoped connections, credential vault, recording file download
- Health check and system status endpoints
- CORS and request tracing middleware
- Structured JSON logging via `tracing`

#### Frontend SPA (Phase 3)
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite project scaffold
- Typed API client (`api.ts`) covering all backend endpoints
- Setup Wizard with database mode selection and optional Vault configuration
- Admin Settings Dashboard with five tabs: Database migration, SSO/OIDC, Kerberos, Recordings, Access Control
- Role and connection management UI (create, list, map roles to connections)
- User list viewer
- Connection dashboard with credential vault (Vault-encrypted password save)
- Session client mounting `guacamole-common-js` to HTML5 Canvas with dynamic resolution scaling
- Paginated, hash-verified audit log viewer
- Responsive navigation layout with active route highlighting
- nginx reverse proxy configuration for SPA fallback and API proxying
- Production Dockerfile (multi-stage Node build → nginx)
- Dark theme CSS design system

#### CI/CD (Phase 4)
- GitHub Actions workflow (`build-guacd.yml`) for automated weekly upstream guacd builds
- Automatic latest release tag detection from `apache/guacamole-server`
- Multi-platform Docker build with GHCR push and GitHub Actions cache
- Manual dispatch with version override input

### Security
- All user credentials encrypted at rest using envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM + Vault Transit KEK)
- Plaintext DEKs zeroized from memory immediately after use
- OIDC tokens validated against provider JWKS with audience and issuer checks
- Recording file endpoint sanitizes filenames to prevent path traversal
- Admin routes protected by role-based middleware
- Database credentials never logged; Vault tokens stored only in config
- Audit log chain integrity verifiable via SHA-256 hash links
