# Architecture

## Overview

Strata Client is a microservices system that replaces the legacy Java/Tomcat + AngularJS Apache Guacamole stack with a Rust proxy and React SPA. The core stack runs four containers (frontend/nginx, backend, guacd, Vault); optional profiles add a bundled PostgreSQL instance and additional guacd sidecar instances for horizontal scaling. The backend image (Debian trixie-slim) additionally ships `Xvnc` and `chromium` baked in to support the `web` protocol out of the box; the `vdi` protocol is gated behind the [`docker-compose.vdi.yml`](../docker-compose.vdi.yml) overlay because it requires mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` (= host root).

## Containers

### 1. Custom guacd

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Base image | Alpine 3.19 (multi-stage) |
| Source | `guacd/Dockerfile` |
| Network | `guac-internal` (internal only) |
| Port | 4822 (not exposed externally) |

The official Apache Guacamole server daemon, custom-compiled with:
- **FreeRDP 3** (`ARG FREERDP_VERSION=3`) for modern RDP support. The
  custom guacd builds against whichever FreeRDP 3.x ships with the
  base image (Alpine 3.23 community + edge currently resolves to
  `freerdp-3.25.0-r0`; Debian 13 / Trixie still ships
  `freerdp-3.24.x`). Patch `006-freerdp325-authenticate-ex.patch`
  (added in v1.3.2) `#include`s `<freerdp/version.h>` and uses the
  `FREERDP_VERSION_MAJOR` / `FREERDP_VERSION_MINOR` preprocessor
  macros to switch between the legacy four-argument
  `Authenticate(freerdp*, char**, char**, char**)` callback (FreeRDP
  ≤ 3.24) and the new five-argument
  `AuthenticateEx(freerdp*, char**, char**, char**, rdp_auth_reason)`
  callback (FreeRDP ≥ 3.25), so the same source tree compiles
  cleanly on both Alpine edge and Debian Trixie.
- **Kerberos** (`krb5-dev` at build, `krb5` + `krb5-libs` at runtime) for GSSAPI/NLA authentication
- **H.264 GFX** — `ffmpeg-dev` / `ffmpeg-libs` for FreeRDP 3 GFX pipeline with H.264 encoding, dramatically lowering bandwidth for RDP sessions

The build pipeline applies a numbered series of unified-diff
patches under [`guacd/patches/`](../guacd/patches/) to the
upstream `apache/guacamole-server` tree (pinned to commit
`2980cf0`, release 1.6.1) before `autoreconf -fi && ./configure`.
The patches are applied in lexicographic order via the loop in
[`guacd/Dockerfile`](../guacd/Dockerfile), with `git apply`
preferred and a `patch -p1 -F3` fallback for fuzz tolerance:

| Patch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `001-freerdp3-debian13.patch` | Build fixes for FreeRDP 3 on Debian 13 / Trixie. |
| `002-kerberos-nla.patch` | Routes Kerberos credential prompts through guacd's auth callback so SSO + NLA actually work. |
| `003-null-guard-and-config-h.patch` | Hardening: NULL guards on a handful of hot paths and consistent `config.h` inclusion. |
| `004-h264-display-worker.patch` | Hooks FreeRDP's RDPGFX `SurfaceCommand` callback and emits the custom `4.h264` Guacamole instruction (see "[H.264 GFX passthrough]" below). |
| `005-refresh-rect-on-resize.patch` | Marks the entire layer dirty after `gdi_resize` and asks the RDP server to re-send pixels for the full new desktop area, eliminating black "ghost regions" along the edge of the canvas after a server-driven RDP resize (v1.3.2). |
| `006-freerdp325-authenticate-ex.patch` | Selects between the legacy `Authenticate` callback and the new `AuthenticateEx` callback on `struct rdp_freerdp` based on `FREERDP_VERSION_MAJOR`/`FREERDP_VERSION_MINOR`, restoring the build on FreeRDP 3.25+ while keeping it green on 3.24 (v1.3.2). |

After the loop, the Dockerfile runs two `grep -q` assertions on
the post-patch `src/protocols/rdp/rdp.c` to verify that
`#include <freerdp/version.h>` and
`rdp_inst->AuthenticateEx = rdp_freerdp_authenticate;` are
present — defence-in-depth catch for silent semantic regressions
of patch 006 (the first iteration of which applied successfully
but selected the wrong `#if` branch because the version macros
were undefined). Patch files are pinned to LF line endings via
[`guacd/patches/.gitattributes`](../guacd/patches/.gitattributes)
because byte-sensitive unified-diff hunks fail to apply when CRLF
sneaks in via `core.autocrlf=true` on Windows.

Multiple guacd instances can be deployed using the `--profile scale` Docker Compose profile (e.g. `guacd-2`). The backend distributes connections across instances using a round-robin `GuacdPool`.

Volumes:
- `guac-recordings` → `/var/lib/guacamole/recordings` — session recording storage
- `krb5-config` → `/etc/krb5` — dynamically generated `krb5.conf`
- `backend-config` → `/app/config` (read-only) — custom `resolv.conf` written by the backend for DNS configuration

**Custom DNS resolution:** The guacd container uses a custom `entrypoint.sh` wrapper that checks for `/app/config/resolv.conf` on startup. If present, it copies the file to `/etc/resolv.conf`, enabling the container to resolve internal hostnames (e.g. `.local`, `.dmz.local` domains). The entrypoint then drops privileges to the `guacd` user via `su-exec` before launching the daemon. DNS servers and search domains are configured via the Admin Settings Network tab and written to the shared `backend-config` volume by the backend. Docker's embedded DNS (`127.0.0.11`) is always appended as a fallback nameserver so existing connections that resolve via public DNS continue working.

**Recording write semantics (v1.1.0+):** guacd writes session recordings into the shared `guac-recordings` volume as `guacd:guacd` (uid/gid 100/101 inside the Alpine guacd container) at mode `0640` — group-only-read. The upstream `guacamole-server` `recording.c` `open()` hard-codes mode `0640`, so this is independent of the in-container `umask`. This gid is the integration point with the backend: the backend's `entrypoint.sh` reads the gid off the volume at startup and adds the `strata` user to a matching local group via `usermod -aG`, so historic playback works under standard POSIX group-read without requiring `DAC_OVERRIDE`. The fix is volume-agnostic — Docker named volumes, bind-mounts, NFSv3/v4 with preserved gids, and CIFS with `uid=,gid=` mount options all work transparently.

### 2. Rust Backend

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | Rust (2021 edition) |
| Framework | Axum 0.8 + Tokio |
| Source | `backend/` |
| Port | 8080 |

The central orchestrator. Responsibilities:

- **Bootstrap & config** — detects `config.toml` on startup; enters setup mode if missing
- **Database** — connects to local or external PostgreSQL; runs advisory-lock-protected migrations
- **Auth** — multi-method authentication system:
  - **SSO/OIDC** — dynamic IdP discovery via JWKS, secure client secret storage in Vault, and automatic session establishment.
  - **Local Auth** — built-in credentials (Argon2id) with global enable/disable toggle, minimum 12-character password policy, and dedicated password change / admin reset endpoints.
  - **Session tokens** — short-lived access tokens (20 min) with `HttpOnly` refresh cookies (8 hr), proactive activity-based silent refresh, per-user session tracking (`active_sessions` table), and a pre-expiry countdown warning toast.
  - **Enforcement** — strict backend policy check on every login attempt ensures disabled methods cannot be accessed.
- **Vault** — envelope encryption for stored credentials via Vault Transit
- **Tunnel** — bidirectional WebSocket ↔ TCP proxy to guacd with protocol handshake injection; supports H.264 GFX pipeline parameters for RDP
- **guacd pool** — round-robin connection distribution across multiple guacd instances (`GuacdPool`)
- **Metrics** — per-session bandwidth tracking (bytes in/out) with aggregate metrics endpoint
- **Config push** — generates `krb5.conf` (multi-realm), toggles recordings, manages SSO settings
- **AD sync** — scheduled LDAP/LDAPS queries against Active Directory to discover and import computer accounts; supports simple bind and Kerberos keytab auth, custom CA certificates, multiple search bases per source, gMSA/MSA exclusion filters, and configurable connection defaults (RDP performance flags, session recording parameters)
- **Password management** — privileged account password checkout and rotation for AD-managed service accounts; configurable password generation policy, LDAP `unicodePwd` reset, Vault-sealed credential storage, approval workflows with explicit account-to-role scoping (each approval role is mapped to specific managed AD accounts), dedicated "Search Base OUs" for user discovery (allowing separate scoping from device discovery), **scheduled future-dated checkouts** (requests between now + 30 s and now + 14 days sit idle with no credential material until the scheduled moment, at which point the existing 60-second expiration worker activates them), **emergency approval bypass (break-glass)** per AD sync config — gated by `pm_allow_emergency_bypass`, requires ≥ 10-character justification, **hard-capped at 30 minutes** server-side, writes a dedicated `checkout.emergency_bypass` audit event, surfaces an ⚡ Emergency badge across Credentials and Approvals views, background workers for checkout expiration and zero-knowledge auto-rotation, requester username resolution for approver visibility, and decided-by tracking with self-approval detection
- **Connection health checks** — background TCP probing of every connection's hostname:port every 2 minutes; results (online/offline/unknown) persisted and exposed via API for dashboard status indicators
- **DNS configuration** — admin-configurable DNS servers and search domains written to a shared Docker volume as `resolv.conf`; guacd containers apply this on startup for internal hostname resolution; Docker's embedded DNS is preserved as fallback
- **Quick Share (file store)** — session-scoped temporary file CDN; files uploaded via multipart POST are stored on disk, each keyed by a random unguessable token. Download endpoint is unauthenticated (the token is the capability). Files are automatically cleaned up when the tunnel disconnects. Limits: 20 files per session, 500 MB each. The frontend Quick Share panel is **protocol-aware (v1.3.0+)**: SSH / Telnet sessions render the copy-snippet as `curl -fLOJ '<url>'` (paste-into-shell friendly); RDP / VNC / web kiosks render the bare HTTPS URL. A "Copy as" `Select` dropdown lets the operator override per-session: `URL`, `curl`, `wget --content-disposition`, or `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri … -OutFile … (Windows)`
- **Audit** — SHA-256 hash-chained append-only log

### 3. Frontend SPA

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript |
| Framework | React 19 + Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Runtime | nginx (production) |
| Source | `frontend/` |
| Ports | 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS when certs mounted) |

The frontend nginx container serves as the primary gateway for all external traffic. It handles:
- **Reverse proxying** — routes `/api/*` to the Rust backend (including WebSocket upgrades for tunnel connections). The shared `common.fragment` declares `resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=10s ipv6=off;` (Docker's embedded DNS) and uses a `set $backend_upstream "backend:8080";` variable as the `proxy_pass` target so the upstream is re-resolved per request rather than cached at process start. **(v1.3.0+)** This avoids the historical `[emerg] host not found in upstream "backend"` boot failure when the backend container was briefly unreachable during `docker compose up -d --build`; nginx now stays up and returns `502 Bad Gateway` for the duration of any backend outage, recovering automatically when the upstream comes back
- **SSL termination** — when TLS certificates are mounted at `/etc/nginx/ssl/`, nginx serves HTTPS on port 443 with Mozilla Intermediate cipher configuration, HSTS, and automatic HTTP→HTTPS redirection
- **Security headers** — `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` on every response
- **Compression** — gzip for text, CSS, JS, JSON, and SVG assets
- **SPA fallback** — `try_files` to `index.html` for client-side routing

Pages:
- **Setup Wizard** — first-boot database and Vault configuration with bundled/external/skip vault mode selector
- **Dashboard** — user's connections with connect/credential vault, multi-select for tiled view, last-accessed tracking, favorites filter, group view toggle (flat list or collapsible group headers), and connection health status indicators (green/red/gray dots showing online/offline/unknown from background TCP probes)
- **Session Client** — HTML5 Canvas via `guacamole-common-js` (vendored 1.6.0 bundle with H.264 GFX passthrough; v0.28.0+) with clipboard sync (including pop-out windows), file transfer, a unified **Session Bar** dock consolidating all tools (Sharing, Quick Share, Keyboard, etc.) into a sleek right-side overlay, **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+K`) for instant connection search and launch from any session, **keyboard shortcut proxy** (Right Ctrl → Win key, `Ctrl+Alt+\`` → Win+Tab), **Keyboard Lock API** for capturing OS-level shortcuts in fullscreen over HTTPS, **display tags** (optional per-connection colored badge on session thumbnails, user-assignable via a tag picker dropdown), **dynamic browser tab title** (shows the active session's server name, e.g. "SERVER01 — Strata"), pop-out windows that persist across navigation with automatic screen-change detection and re-scaling, browser-based multi-monitor support via canvas slicing (Chromium Window Management API) with ~30 fps `setInterval` render loop (avoids `requestAnimationFrame` throttling when popups have focus), `MutationObserver`-based cursor sync across all secondary windows, horizontal-only layout (all monitors arranged left-to-right regardless of physical vertical position — best supported configuration is all landscape monitors side by side; monitors above or below appear as slices to the right), aggregate height capped to primary monitor height for taskbar visibility, `moveTo`/`resizeTo`/`requestFullscreen` auto-maximize on secondary popups, live `screenschange` detection for hot-plugged monitors, screen count detection shown in the toolbar tooltip, Chrome popup-blocker bypass via in-gesture `getScreenDetails()` for 3+ monitors, and Brave/privacy-browser compatibility, Quick Share panel (conditional on file transfer enabled) with drag-and-drop upload and one-click copy-to-clipboard download URLs, expired credential renewal at connect time, and automatic redirect to the next active session when one ends. (The legacy `forceDisplayRepaint()` ghost-pixel mitigation and the manual **Refresh display** button from v0.25.1–v0.27.x have been retired — H.264 passthrough eliminates the underlying ghost class.)
- **Tiled View** — multi-connection grid layout with per-tile focus, keyboard broadcast, and inline credential prompts
- **NVR Player** — admin-only read-only session observer with 5-minute rewind buffer, replay→live transition, and timeline controls
- **Sessions** — unified role-based page with Live Sessions and Recording History tabs; users see their own sessions, admins see all with kill/observe/rewind controls
- **Login** — unified login portal supporting local credentials and OIDC Single Sign-On; dynamically adjusts based on enabled authentication methods
- **Admin Settings** — tabbed UI for health, SSO, auth method toggles, Kerberos (multi-realm), vault, recordings, network (DNS configuration), access control, connection group management, AD sync sources (with inline password management configuration: enable toggle, credential source, target filter with preview, password policy, auto-rotation), password management (approval roles with explicit account scoping via searchable dropdown and chip tags, account mappings, checkout requests with decided-by column and self-approval detection), session analytics and metrics
- **Approvals** — dedicated page for pending password checkout approval decisions, visible only to users assigned to approval roles. Premium card layout with requester avatar, CN-from-DN display, labeled duration and justification sections, and approve/deny action buttons
- **Audit Logs** — paginated, hash-chained log viewer
- **Theme Toggle** — sidebar button cycling System → Light → Dark themes with localStorage persistence
- **PWA** — installable Progressive Web App with offline shell caching via service worker; standalone display mode on mobile and tablet

### 4. PostgreSQL

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Image | `postgres:16-alpine` |
| Port | 5432 (internal only) |
| Volume | `postgres-data` |

Bundled for zero-configuration first boot. Can be replaced with an external database at any time through the Admin UI.

### 5. HashiCorp Vault

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Image | `hashicorp/vault:1.19` |
| Storage | File backend (`/vault/data`) |
| Port | 8200 (internal only) |
| Volume | `vault-data` |
| Mode | Bundled (auto-provisioned) or External (user-provided) |

Bundled in Docker Compose for zero-configuration credential encryption. On first boot, the backend automatically:
1. Initializes the Vault (single unseal key, single key share)
2. Unseals the Vault
3. Enables the Transit Secrets Engine
4. Creates the encryption key (`guac-master-key` by default)
5. Stores the root token and unseal key in `config.toml`

On subsequent startups, the backend auto-unseals using the stored unseal key.

Alternatively, users can connect to an **external Vault instance** by selecting "External" mode during setup or in Admin Settings, providing their own address, token, and transit key name.

#### Proxy loop: decoupled sink + bounded channel

The tunnel proxy in [`backend/src/tunnel.rs`](../backend/src/tunnel.rs)
does not drive the `axum::WebSocket` directly from the main
`tokio::select!` loop. Doing so would couple output-path backpressure
to the input path: when guacd floods bitmap updates (e.g. the Windows
Win+Arrow window-snap animation, which emits a burst of draw
instructions in ~200 ms), the browser's WebSocket receive buffer
fills, `ws.send().await` inside the `tcp_read` arm blocks, and *while
it is blocked* the `ws.recv()` arm cannot run. Mouse/keyboard events
from the browser then queue up in the kernel TCP buffer and arrive at
guacd in bursts — users perceive this as rendering freezes, mouse
"acceleration," and keyboard lag.

The actual architecture decouples the sink from the select loop:

```

- **`ws.split()`** separates the WebSocket into `ws_sink` (owned
  permanently by the writer task) and `ws_stream` (polled by the
  select loop's input arm).
- **`tokio::sync::mpsc::channel::<Message>(1024)`** is the handoff
  point. 1024 messages is generous runway for any sustained draw
  rate; only a pathologically slow browser can back it up, and even
  then `ws_tx.send().await` yields (the future-returning send gives
  back control to the executor so the select can continue polling
  `ws_stream`/`shared_input_rx`).
- **Writer task** runs a trivial `while let Some(msg) = ws_rx.recv()`
  → `ws_sink.send(msg).await` loop. All I/O latency on the output
  path lives inside this task; the main select loop never awaits
  `ws_sink` directly.
- **Shutdown path** drops `ws_tx`, which causes `ws_rx.recv()` to
  return `None` and the writer task to flush + close the sink. A
  2 s `tokio::time::timeout` + `writer_task.abort()` fallback covers
  the case where the sink is wedged.

Additional tunnel details:

- **Web-protocol kiosk eviction (v1.3.0+).** When `protocol == "web"`,
  the tunnel route in [`backend/src/routes/tunnel.rs`](../backend/src/routes/tunnel.rs)
  captures an `Arc<WebRuntimeRegistry>` and the requesting `user_id`
  before the WebSocket upgrade. After `tunnel::proxy` returns
  (success or error), the route calls
  `web_runtime.evict(connection_id, user_id)` to drop the registry's
  reference to the kiosk's `Arc<WebSessionHandle>`. If no other tab is
  holding the same handle, refcount-zero `Drop` SIGKILLs the Chromium
  and Xvnc children (`kill_on_drop(true)`), releases the X-display
  slot (`100..=199`) and CDP port (`9222..=9321`), and removes the
  per-session profile tempdir (with its NSS DB inside). A
  `web.session.end` audit row with `reason: "tunnel_disconnect"` is
  written so the lifecycle event is visible. Before v1.3.0 only the
  idle reaper and process-death paths ran in production, so closing a
  browser tab without first hitting *Disconnect* leaked the kiosk
  until the reaper caught up.

- Guacamole instructions are delimited by `;` and can be split across
  TCP reads. The proxy maintains a `pending: Vec<u8>` that is drained
  up to the last `;` on each read (via `Vec::drain`, which is O(n) on
  the remainder — meaningfully cheaper than the previous `to_vec()`
  reallocation on large bitmap floods).
- The pending buffer is hard-capped at 16 MiB. Exceeding the cap emits
  a Guacamole `error "Protocol error: instruction exceeds pending
  buffer" "521"` instruction to the browser and closes the tunnel.
  The old behaviour of silently calling `pending.clear()` is unsafe
  because the stream would resume mid-token.
- The tunnel ingests non-ASCII WS frames via `str::from_utf8` before
  forwarding; invalid bytes are logged and dropped.
- Keepalives: `Ping` every 15 s, disconnect if no `Pong` within 30 s.
- Per-session bandwidth counters (`bytes_from_guacd`, `bytes_to_guacd`)
  are updated atomically on every read/write for the session-metrics
  endpoint.
- **Auth watchdog (v1.3.2; revised v1.4.1).** A 30-second ticker runs
  alongside the proxy loop and forces tunnel teardown on either of
  two conditions: (a) the upgrade-time access token appears in the
  in-memory revocation set
  (`services::token_revocation::is_revoked(token)` — populated by
  `/api/auth/logout`), audit `reason = "revoked"`; or (b) the
  elapsed wall-clock time since the upgrade exceeds
  `MAX_TUNNEL_DURATION = 8h`, audit `reason = "max_duration"`. The
  v1.3.2 implementation also reaped on the access token's `exp`
  claim, but that broke under proactive token rotation — the
  WebSocket cannot learn that the cookie was rotated, so the cached
  `exp` reaped active sessions every 20 minutes; v1.4.1 removes
  that path. Full prose at
  [`docs/security.md` § WebSocket-tunnel auth watchdog](security.md#websocket-tunnel-auth-watchdog-v132-revised-v141).

#### H.264 GFX passthrough (v0.28.0+)

As of v0.28.0, RDP H.264 frames travel **end-to-end without a server-side
transcode step**. The path is:

```
Windows RDP host (AVC444 enabled)
    │  (RDPGFX H.264 stream)
    ▼
FreeRDP 3 inside guacd
    │  SurfaceCommand callback (patched)
    ▼
guacd display worker
    │  queues NAL units on guac_display_layer
    │  emits "4.h264,…" Guacamole instruction on per-frame flush
    ▼
WebSocket tunnel (passthrough — backend never decodes)
    ▼
Vendored guacamole-common-js 1.6.0 in browser
    │  4.h264 opcode handler routes NAL units to H264Decoder
    ▼
WebCodecs VideoDecoder (hardware-accelerated where available)
    ▼
Display canvas
```

The four cooperating components:

1. **`guacd/patches/004-h264-display-worker.patch`** — a byte-identical
   port of upstream `sol1/rustguac`'s H.264 display-worker patch
   (SHA `7a13504c2b051ec651d39e1068dc7174dc796f97`). Hooks FreeRDP's
   RDPGFX `SurfaceCommand` callback, queues AVC NAL units on each
   `guac_display_layer`, and emits them as a custom `4.h264` Guacamole
   instruction during the per-frame flush. **Supersedes** the v0.27.0
   `004-refresh-on-noop-size.patch` at the same path.
2. **Vendored `guacamole-common-js` 1.6.0**
   ([`frontend/src/lib/guacamole-vendor.js`](../frontend/src/lib/guacamole-vendor.js)) —
   bundles `H264Decoder` (line ~13408), the `4.h264` opcode handler
   (line ~16755), and a sync-point gate `waitForPending` (line ~17085)
   that prevents the decoder being asked to flush before its pending-
   frame queue has drained. **Stock `guacamole-common-js` does not handle
   the `h264` opcode**; the vendored bundle is required.
3. **Backend RDP defaults** ([`backend/src/tunnel.rs`](../backend/src/tunnel.rs)) —
   `full_param_map()` seeds `color-depth=32`, `disable-gfx=true`,
   `enable-h264=false`, `force-lossless=false`, `cursor=local`, plus
   the explicit `enable-*` / `disable-*` toggles that FreeRDP's
   `settings.c` requires (empty ≠ `"false"` in many guacd code paths).
   These defaults match the upstream
   [sol1/rustguac](https://github.com/sol1/rustguac) baseline that
   Strata's custom guacd is patched against, so a brand-new
   connection with no admin overrides behaves identically to a
   stock rustguac deployment. The per-connection `extras` allowlist
   permits `disable-gfx`, `disable-offscreen-caching`, `disable-auth`,
   `enable-h264`, `force-lossless`, and the related GFX toggles so
   the admin UI can override defaults per connection. The handshake
   driver gates `video/h264` mimetype advertisement on the resolved
   `enable-h264` value, so leaving GFX disabled or H.264 disabled
   will silently fall back to the bitmap path even on AVC444-capable
   hosts.
4. **Connection-form GFX/H.264 interlock (v1.1.0+)** — the RDP
   Codecs panel of `frontend/src/pages/admin/connectionForm.tsx`
   renders the *Enable graphics pipeline (GFX)* checkbox as ticked
   only when `disable-gfx === "false"` (i.e. it reflects what the
   backend will actually negotiate, not the absence of a value).
   The companion *Enable H.264 (AVC444)* checkbox is rendered
   disabled whenever GFX is off — the `video/h264` mimetype cannot
   be negotiated without GFX. Ticking H.264 forces
   `disable-gfx="false"` for you, and unticking GFX clears any
   previously-set `enable-h264`, so the form cannot be saved into
   an unreachable state. The `AdSyncTab.tsx` default-parameter
   editor mirrors this interlock so AD-synced connections inherit
   the same UX. See `CHANGELOG.md` 1.1.0 for the full UX
   rationale.
5. **Windows host AVC444 configuration** — the helper script
   [`docs/Configure-RdpAvc444.ps1`](Configure-RdpAvc444.ps1) audits
   the host registry, detects whether a hardware GPU is usable, and
   prompts before applying the recommended values. The full operator
   runbook is [`docs/h264-passthrough.md`](h264-passthrough.md).

The passthrough path **eliminates** the cross-frame ghost class that
v0.27.0's Refresh Rect mitigation (below) targeted: there is no
intermediate transcode step that can lose state across frames. The
v0.27.0 Refresh Display button has been retired from the Session Bar.

### Backend SSH defaults (v1.3.1+)

`full_param_map()` in [`backend/src/tunnel.rs`](../backend/src/tunnel.rs)
also seeds a parallel set of defaults for `protocol == "ssh"`
connections so a brand-new SSH connection behaves identically to
the upstream [sol1/rustguac](https://github.com/sol1/rustguac)
baseline:

| Parameter               | Default                | Why                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terminal-type`         | `xterm-256color`       | Exported as `TERM` on the remote PTY. Without it OpenSSH defaults to `TERM=linux`, which does not advertise `smcup`/`rmcup` and breaks `nano` / `less` alt-screen restore. |
| `color-scheme`          | `gray-black`           | Rustguac-default SGR palette; without it guacd falls back to `black-white` and inverts most users' expectations. |
| `scrollback`            | `1000`                 | Lifts guacd's in-buffer line count from its built-in default (~256) to 1000.                         |
| `font-name`             | `monospace`            | Rustguac parity.                                                                                     |
| `font-size`             | `12`                   | Rustguac parity.                                                                                     |
| `backspace`             | `127`                  | DEL — what every modern Linux distro ships as the SSH default; stops `^?` characters appearing on Backspace. |
| `locale`                | `en_US.UTF-8`          | Required for UTF-8 box-drawing characters in `htop`, `mc`, `tmux` status bars.                       |
| `server-alive-interval` | `0`                    | Disables guacd-side keepalives — Guacamole's own keep-alive instructions already provide liveness.   |

The corresponding three keys (`color-scheme`, `locale`,
`server-alive-interval`) have been added to
`is_allowed_guacd_param` so admin overrides via the per-connection
`extras` map can set them explicitly. The SFTP wiring lives in
the same `if self.protocol == "ssh"` branch so all SSH-only
parameter logic is in one place.

Verification flows in priority order:

1. **Authoritative** — Windows Event Viewer →
   `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows >
   RemoteDesktopServices-RdpCoreTS > Operational`:
   - Event ID **162** = AVC444 mode active
   - Event ID **170** = hardware encoding active
2. guacd logs include `H.264 passthrough enabled for RDPGFX channel`
3. WebSocket trace shows `4.h264,…` instructions in DevTools Network
4. `client._h264Decoder?.stats()` shows `framesDecoded > 0`

If the host is not configured for AVC444, `enable-h264=true` is a
no-op: guacd loads the H.264 hook (visible in logs) but no
`SurfaceCommand` callbacks fire and the session falls back silently to
the bitmap path.

**Known limitation — DevTools-induced ghosting**: Chromium-based
browsers throttle GPU-canvas compositing and `requestAnimationFrame`
cadence on tabs whose DevTools panel is open. Cached tile blits fall
behind the live frame stream and the user perceives ghosting that
resembles a codec problem but is not. Closing DevTools (or detaching
to a separate window) restores normal compositor behaviour. This is
not fixable in the Strata client.

#### H.264 GFX reference-frame corruption (recovery path in v0.27.0)

> **Status — superseded by v0.28.0.** Retained for historical context.
> The cross-frame ghost class described below cannot occur with the
> v0.28.0 passthrough decoder, because there is no intermediate
> server-side transcode step to lose state across frames. The Refresh
> Display button has been retired from the Session Bar.

With `enable-gfx-h264=true` (the default for RDP connections), FreeRDP
hands decoded H.264 NAL units to guacamole-common-js's `VideoPlayer`
which renders them to the display canvas. H.264 is a delta-compressed
codec: every P-frame references one or more prior frames. If the
reference chain desynchronises between the server-side encoder and the
in-browser decoder — for example, a packet reordering window during a
rapid series of window minimise/maximise animations that briefly
exceeds the GFX cache ceiling — the browser continues to decode
subsequent deltas against a now-wrong reference. Visually, this appears
as multiple overlapping window states composited on one canvas.

v0.27.0 ships an in-session recovery path: the forked guacd
([`guacd/patches/004-refresh-on-noop-size.patch`](../guacd/patches/004-refresh-on-noop-size.patch))
intercepts a Guacamole `size W H` instruction whose dimensions match
the current remote desktop size (a no-op resize) and sends an RDP
`Refresh Rect` PDU to the RDP server via
`context->update->RefreshRect()`. Refresh Rect asks the server to
retransmit the specified region; on Windows servers this is expected
to be emitted as an H.264 IDR keyframe that resets the decoder's
reference-frame chain. A 1-second per-session cooldown guards against
accidental flooding. The Refresh Display button in `SessionBar` wires
a compositor nudge AND a no-op `client.sendSize(cw, ch)` through
`manualRefresh()` in `SessionClient.tsx` to drive this path.

Server-dependent behaviour: MS-RDPEGFX specifies Refresh Rect as valid
in GFX mode but does not mandate that servers emit an IDR keyframe in
response. On Windows 10/11 and Windows Server 2019/2022 the ghost is
expected to clear within one frame; on non-Microsoft or legacy RDP
targets this may be a no-op. Two fallback workarounds remain:

- **User-driven**: the Reconnect button in `SessionBar` performs a full
  `client.disconnect()` + re-establish, which cleanly re-initialises the
  codec state on both ends.
- **Operator-driven**: the Admin → Connection form's **Disable H.264
  codec** toggle (which writes `enable-gfx-h264=false` into the extras
  map) falls back to the RemoteFX codec, which has no cross-frame
  reference chain and cannot exhibit this class of ghost at the cost of
  2–4× higher bandwidth.

Approach note: the no-op-size-hijack was chosen over defining a new
Guacamole protocol opcode (e.g. a `refresh` instruction) so that stock
`guacamole-common-js` — which Strata does not fork — continues to work
unchanged. Stock guacd silently ignores a no-op resize, so the
frontend change is also safe to run against an un-patched guacd (the
compositor nudge still fires, the sendSize is a harmless no-op). The
extension is invisible at the wire-protocol layer.

### Envelope Encryption (Credential Save)

```
1. Rust generates random 32-byte DEK
2. Rust encrypts password with DEK (AES-256-GCM) → ciphertext + nonce
3. Rust sends plaintext DEK to Vault POST /transit/encrypt/guac-master-key
4. Vault returns wrapped DEK (vault:v1:base64...)
5. Rust stores (ciphertext, wrapped_dek, nonce) in PostgreSQL
6. Rust zeroizes plaintext DEK from memory
```

### Envelope Decryption (Tunnel Handshake)

```
1. Rust fetches (ciphertext, wrapped_dek, nonce) from PostgreSQL
2. Rust sends wrapped DEK to Vault POST /transit/decrypt/guac-master-key
3. Vault returns plaintext DEK
4. Rust decrypts password with DEK (AES-256-GCM)
5. Rust injects plaintext password into guacd handshake
6. Rust zeroizes DEK and password from memory
```

**Why MJML?** MJML compiles to table-based HTML that survives every major
client (Gmail, Outlook desktop/web/mobile, Apple Mail, Thunderbird, K-9).
Hand-rolling that markup is fragile; generating it from MJML lets the
templates focus on layout intent rather than client quirks. The renderer
runs server-side via the [`mrml`](https://github.com/jdrouet/mrml) Rust
port — no Node.js round-trip is required at boot or at send time.

**Outlook dark-mode wrapper.** `wrap_for_outlook_dark_mode` adds a VML
namespace on `<html>`, a full-bleed `<v:background fill="t">` rectangle
inside an `<!--[if gte mso 9]>` conditional, and an Outlook-only
stylesheet. VML backgrounds are immune to Outlook desktop's dark-mode
inversion engine, so the result is a clean dark-themed email even on
Outlook for Windows in dark mode. Future templates inherit the fix
automatically.

**Standalone templates only.** mrml's XML parser does not tolerate
Tera's `{% include %}` mechanism (whitespace from the include directive
breaks parsing at the section/column boundary). Each of the four
templates is therefore self-contained: no `_header.mjml` /
`_footer.mjml` partials, no `<mj-attributes>` block, font-family set
per-element. Context values are escaped through a custom `xml_escape`
helper (only the five XML-significant characters: `& < > " '`) — using
`ammonia::clean_text` over-escapes (it encodes spaces as `&#32;`) and
breaks rendering.

**Vault-sealed SMTP password.** The SMTP password is never stored in
`system_settings`. It is sealed via the existing
`crate::services::vault::seal_setting` helper and unsealed at send time.
The `PUT /api/admin/notifications/smtp` endpoint refuses to save
credentials when Vault is sealed or running in stub mode — a
half-configured install should fail loudly rather than silently leak the
password to disk in plaintext.

**Dispatcher hooks.** Four call sites in `routes/user.rs` invoke
`notifications::spawn_dispatch`:

| Call site | Event |
|---|---|
| `request_checkout` (Pending branch) | `CheckoutEvent::Pending` → all approvers for the target account |
| `request_checkout` (SelfApproved branch) | `CheckoutEvent::SelfApproved` → audit recipients (bypasses opt-out) |
| `decide_checkout` (Approved branch) | `CheckoutEvent::Approved` → original requester |
| `decide_checkout` (Rejected branch) | `CheckoutEvent::Rejected` → original requester |

`spawn_dispatch` is fire-and-forget — it returns immediately so the
user-facing checkout request is never blocked by mail delivery. All
errors are logged via `tracing` and visible in `email_deliveries`.

## Command Palette (v0.31.0)

The in-session Command Palette (default `Ctrl+K`, user-rebindable per
v0.30.1) exposes both **connection search** (typed text without a
leading colon) and a **scriptable command surface** (typed text with a
leading colon). The command surface is composed of two registries:

1. **Built-in commands** — hard-coded in
   [`frontend/src/components/CommandPalette.tsx`](../frontend/src/components/CommandPalette.tsx).
   Names: `reload`, `disconnect`, `close`, `fullscreen`, `commands`,
   `explorer`. Built-in
   handlers reuse the same primitives as the SessionBar (e.g.
   `requestFullscreenWithLock`) so behaviour is identical regardless of
   how the action is invoked. Built-in names are reserved — user
   mappings cannot collide with them.
2. **User mappings** — sourced from `user_preferences.preferences ->
   commandMappings` (JSONB array, max 50 entries per user). Each
   mapping is a discriminated union with `trigger`, `action`, and
   `args`. The six allowed actions are `open-connection`, `open-folder`,
   `open-tag`, `open-page`, `paste-text`, and `open-path`; the
   `open-page` `args.path` is locked to the seven-value enum
   `/dashboard | /profile | /credentials | /settings | /admin | /audit | /recordings`,
   `paste-text` `args.text` is capped at 4096 characters, and
   `open-path` `args.path` is capped at 1024 characters and rejected
   if it contains any control characters. The `paste-text` action
   writes `args.text` to the active session's remote clipboard via
   `Guacamole.Client.createClipboardStream`, then fires a Ctrl+V
   keystroke (keysyms `0xffe3` + `0x76`) so the focused remote
   application actually receives the paste. The `open-path` action
   drives the Windows Run dialog on the remote target: it sends Win+R
   (keysyms `0xffeb` + `0x72`), pastes the path the same way, then
   sends Enter (`0xff0d`) — which makes Explorer (or whichever app is
   registered for that URI scheme) open the path. The audit stream
   logs only `{ text_length }` / `{ path_length }` for these two
   actions so potentially sensitive payloads never leave the
   originating user's preferences blob.

Validation is enforced server-side inside
[`backend/src/services/user_preferences.rs`](../backend/src/services/user_preferences.rs)
(`validate_command_mappings`), so a frontend that bypasses client-side
checks still cannot poison the database.

### Resolver and ghost-text autocomplete

When the input starts with `:`, the palette merges the built-in registry
with the user's mappings into a single sorted candidate list. Two
quantities are derived from that list and the current query:

- `matchingCommands` — every candidate whose name starts with the
  query slug. Drives the inline `:commands` listing and the empty
  state.
- `ghostSuffix` — the longest common prefix shared by every member of
  `matchingCommands` minus the already-typed slug. Rendered in a
  zero-position-offset, `pointer-events-none`, `opacity: 0.35`
  overlay. **Tab** or **Right Arrow** (when the caret is at end-of-
  input) commits the suggestion.

### Audit flow

Every successful command execution writes one immutable, hash-chained
`command.executed` row to the `audit_logs` table via the new
fire-and-forget endpoint:

```
frontend executeCommand()
  ├── await postCommandAudit({ trigger, action, args, target_id })   // best-effort, .catch swallowed
  └── run the action (navigate / disconnect / reload / fullscreen)
```

The audit POST is intentionally invoked _before_ the action runs so
the audit row captures intent even if the action throws. The endpoint
([`POST /api/user/command-audit`](api-reference.md#post-apiusercommand-audit))
hard-codes `action_type = "command.executed"` server-side; client-side
poisoning of the audit-event taxonomy is impossible. The chain-hash
integrity guarantees described in
[security.md → Audit Trail](security.md#audit-trail) apply uniformly to
this stream.

## DMZ split topology (optional)

Strata Client supports an optional split-host deployment where a
public-facing **DMZ node** terminates TLS and serves the SPA, while
all business logic, secrets, and database access remain on a private
**internal node** that the public network cannot reach. This is
intended for deployments where the internal Strata host must not
have any inbound listener exposed to the Internet (regulatory zoning,
defence-in-depth, or hosting-provider policy).

```
       Internet ─▶ ┌──────────────────────────┐
                   │  DMZ NODE  (strata-dmz)  │
                   │  • TLS 1.3 termination   │
                   │  • SPA static serving    │
                   │  • OIDC redirect handler │
                   │  • Rate limiting         │
                   │  • mTLS *server* (link)  │  ← inbound only
                   └────────────┬─────────────┘
                       (link)   │  outbound from internal
                                ▼
                   ┌──────────────────────────┐
                   │ INTERNAL NODE (strata-   │
                   │  backend)                │

                   │  • Outbound link client  │  ← initiates the dial
                   └──────────────────────────┘
```

The link is the only channel between the two halves and reverses the
usual client-server polarity: the **internal node dials out** to the
DMZ node and holds a long-lived authenticated tunnel open. The DMZ
node multiplexes inbound HTTP/WebSocket requests onto that tunnel.
This means the firewall between the DMZ network and the internal
network can deny **all** inbound traffic to the internal host — the
internal half only ever makes outbound TCP connections to the DMZ
host's link port.

### Trust posture

- **No business secrets on the DMZ host.** It holds two key
  materials: a public TLS cert (browser-facing) and a per-link PSK
  used to authenticate the internal node when it dials in. It holds
  **no** Vault tokens, no DB credentials, no AD bind passwords, no
  user JWT signing keys. Compromise of the DMZ host yields only the
  ability to drop traffic, not to read or forge it (sessions remain
  bound to the internal node's JWT signing key).
- **Wire protocol** (`strata-link/1.0`): length-prefixed JSON
  handshake (see `crates/strata-protocol/src/handshake.rs`) followed
  by HTTP/2 (h2 0.4) inside the same mTLS connection, ALPN
  `h2,http/1.1`. Custom framing is intentionally minimal — every
  user request is one HTTP/2 stream, WebSockets ride RFC 8441
  Extended CONNECT, and per-stream flow control comes for free.
- **Edge attribution**: the DMZ node stamps a signed bundle of
  request metadata (`x-strata-edge-*` headers — client IP, TLS
  version/cipher/JA3, user-agent, request ID, link ID, timestamp)
  with an HMAC-SHA-256 over the canonical concatenation, keyed by a
  shared `STRATA_DMZ_EDGE_HMAC_KEY`. The internal node verifies the
  HMAC, rejects skew > 60 s, and **strips any `x-strata-edge-*`
  headers that arrive without a valid MAC** so a compromised DMZ
  cannot forge a different client IP into the audit log.
- **Egress posture**: the DMZ pod has no egress permission to the
  internal network in either the compose overlay or the Helm
  NetworkPolicy. The only outbound it makes is DNS to kube-dns. Even
  a fully RCE'd DMZ node cannot reach the database, Vault, or AD.

### Naming

Throughout this codebase the public-facing node is consistently
referred to as the **DMZ node** (`strata-dmz` crate, binary, image,
and Helm chart). The token "edge" is reserved for the
`x-strata-edge-*` request-attribution header bundle stamped by the
DMZ on every forwarded request — it is not a synonym for the node
itself.

### Internal-node supervisor and operator UI (v1.5.0)

The internal node owns the dialler. One **link supervisor** task is
spawned per endpoint listed in `STRATA_DMZ_ENDPOINTS`
([`backend/src/services/dmz_link/supervisor.rs`](../backend/src/services/dmz_link/supervisor.rs)).
Each supervisor runs an exponential-back-off reconnect loop with
jitter and a per-link state machine:

- `connecting` — TCP + TLS handshake in progress.
- `authenticating` — `AuthHello` + PSK challenge–response in flight.
- `initializing` — mTLS handshake succeeded, HTTP/2 preface still
  pending.
- `up` — h2 connection healthy, ready to serve forwarded requests.
- `backoff` — last attempt failed; sleeping before the next try.
- `stopped` — supervisor cancelled (shutdown or Force reconnect).

Operators see this state machine surfaced in real time in
**Admin → DMZ Links**
([`frontend/src/pages/admin/DmzLinksTab.tsx`](../frontend/src/pages/admin/DmzLinksTab.tsx)),
which hits two endpoints:

- `GET /api/admin/dmz-links` returns
  `{ configured: bool, links: [{ endpoint, state, connects, failures,
  since_unix_secs, last_error }, …] }`. Auto-refreshed every 15 s.
- `POST /api/admin/dmz-links/reconnect` drops every link's TCP
  connection and lets the supervisor's back-off loop redial. Used
  during scheduled DMZ restarts and as the first step in the
  incident runbook.

Both endpoints require `can_manage_system` and the standard
`X-CSRF-Token` double-submit cookie. They are documented in
[api-reference.md](api-reference.md#dmz-link-management-v150).

## Extended protocols

In addition to the classic RDP / SSH / VNC connections, Strata
supports three driver-backed connection types where the backend
supervises a workload on the user's behalf:

- **Web Sessions** (`web` protocol) — ephemeral kiosk Chromium inside
  Xvnc, tunnelled as VNC. See [`web-sessions.md`](web-sessions.md).
- **VDI Desktop Containers** (`vdi` protocol) — Strata-managed
  Docker container running xrdp, tunnelled as RDP. See
  [`vdi.md`](vdi.md).
- **Kubernetes Pod Console** (`kubernetes` protocol, v1.4.0) —
  `kubectl attach` / `kubectl exec` into a named pod, rendered as a
  terminal via Guacamole's built-in `kubernetes` client. The custom
  guacd image already builds `libguac-client-kubernetes.so` (gated by a
  Dockerfile guard that fails the build if the .so is missing — see
  `guacd/Dockerfile`). Connection extras carry `pod`, `namespace`,
  `container`, `exec-command`, `use-ssl`, `ca-cert` and `client-cert`;
  the matching `client-key` private bytes live exclusively in a
  Vault-encrypted credential profile and are remapped from the
  profile's password slot into the guacd `client-key` parameter at
  handshake time (see `routes/tunnel.rs`). Operators import their
  `~/.kube/config` via `POST /api/admin/kubernetes/parse-kubeconfig`,
  which extracts the cluster server URL, namespace, CA cert and
  client cert into the form and shows the private key once for the
  operator to paste into a credential profile.

All three extensions land their per-connection configuration in
`connections.extra` (JSONB) and inherit the existing recording, audit,
and credential-mapping pipelines unchanged.

Allocator state machine: `WebDisplayAllocator` keeps a `BTreeSet<u8>`
of free displays; `acquire()` removes the first; `release(display)`
re-inserts. The cap of 100 simultaneous sessions is the size of the
range `:100..:199`. `CdpPortAllocator` mirrors the structure for
`9222..9421`. Both are `Arc<…>` so the runtime can share them across
spawn workers.

Reuse semantics: `WebRuntimeRegistry::ensure(connection_id, user_id,
session_id, spec)` returns the existing handle for a `(connection_id,
user_id)` pair if one is registered and still alive, so a tab refresh
doesn't pay the spawn cost twice. When the tunnel closes the registry
keeps the handle for a short grace window; an idle reaper destroys it
afterwards.

#### Trusted CA bundles for Web Sessions (v1.2.0)

A new admin-managed table `trusted_ca_bundles` stores PEMs once with
a friendly name; any `web` connection can attach a bundle via
`extra.trusted_ca_id`. The runtime path is:

1. `routes/tunnel.rs` resolves `cfg.trusted_ca_id` to the PEM bytes
   via `services::trusted_ca::get(&pool, id)` *before* constructing
   the `WebSpawnSpec`.
2. `WebSpawnSpec.trusted_ca_pem` and `trusted_ca_label` flow into the
   spawn worker.
3. The worker calls `services::trusted_ca::import_pem_into_nss_db(
   &pem, profile_dir, label)` which executes
   `certutil -N --empty-password -d sql:<profile>/.pki/nssdb` followed
   by `certutil -A -d sql:<profile>/.pki/nssdb -n <label> -t "C,," -i <tmp.pem>`.
4. Chromium reads the NSS DB at startup and trusts the supplied roots
   without any `--ignore-certificate-errors` flag.
5. The NSS DB lives inside the per-session profile directory and is
   destroyed with it on session end.

`certutil` is provided by the `libnss3-tools` apt package, baked into
the backend image since v1.2.0. PEMs are validated at upload time
with `rustls-pemfile::certs` + `x509_parser::parse_x509_certificate`
and the parsed `subject` / `not_after` / `fingerprint` (SHA-256 hex,
colon-separated) are cached on the row so list views never re-parse.
The PEM column is treated as **public material** (signatures over
public keys) and is *not* envelope-encrypted via Vault — see the
[Security](security.md) document for the rationale.

                  vdi_containers row upsert
                  (connection_id, user_id, container_name,
                   image, state='running', last_seen_at)
```

Deterministic naming: `container_name_for(connection_id, user_id)`
takes the first 12 hex chars of each UUID, separated by `-`, with the
prefix `strata-vdi-`. The same `(connection, user)` pair always
resolves to the same name, so `ensure_container` short-circuits to a
reuse path when the container already exists.

Ephemeral credentials: when the credential cascade resolves to no
password, `ephemeral_credentials(strata_username)` returns a
`(sanitised_posix_username, fresh_24char_password)` pair. The
sanitised username is a pure function of the Strata username so the
bind-mounted `$HOME` is consistent across reconnects; the password is
fresh per call so the live xrdp instance always sees a new value.

Wire-protocol translation: `tunnel.rs` rewrites
`wire_protocol = "rdp"` and replaces hostname/port with the
network-attached endpoint. The original `vdi` label is preserved on
`nvr_protocol` so recordings keep the operator-facing icon.

Network resolution: `STRATA_VDI_NETWORK` (env var, threaded through
`main.rs`) defaults to
`${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-strata-client}_guac-internal` in the overlay
file so containers join the same Compose-prefixed network as the rest
of the stack.

Socket permission handling: `entrypoint.sh` either creates a
`docker-host` group at the socket's GID (Linux distros) or `chgrp` +
`chmod g+rw` the bind-mount in place (Docker Desktop GID 0). See
[`vdi.md`](vdi.md) § *Docker socket permissions* for the exact
script.

| `resize-method` | `""`             | xrdp's display-update channel drops on resize storms. |
